# LLOYD â€“ Language Layers Over Your Data 

LLOYD is a browser-based demonstration of symbolic tone-drift detection and override logic.  
It listens for semantic, emotional, and motif deviation in user inputâ€”then reroutes response behavior in real time when thresholds are exceeded.

This release showcases an updated drift algorithm (details abstracted), packaged in a Streamlit interface for interpretability and narrative clarity.

## **Highlights** â€“ *Fast Hook Table*  

| ðŸ§  Capability | ðŸš€ Why Itâ€™s Powerful |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Drift-Aware** | Detects tone & symbolic shifts in real time |
| **Override-Ready** | Reroutes responses for safety, empathy, or style |
| **Trigger-Savvy** | Flags words that shift mood or meaning |
| **Emergent-Friendly** | Can guide newer LLMs toward empathetic, adaptive behavior |

## **Core Capabilities** â€“ *Deep Dive Table*  

| Capability | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Tone Drift Detection** | Measures polarity and symbolic deviation from a baseline | Detects shifts in intent, mood, or subtext in real time |
| **Override Logic** | Routes output through alternate response templates when thresholds are exceeded | Enables safety, empathy, or narrative direction |
| **Trigger Mapping** | Flags key words/phrases that signal tone or symbolic shifts | Supports intervention before escalation |
| **DBI Scoring** | Uses a custom drift-bound index to measure change magnitude | Goes beyond sentiment to track symbolic resonance |
| **Side-by-Side Output** | Shows baseline vs. rerouted output | Improves interpretability for testing and tuning |
| **Drift Model** | Analyzes meaning in a multidimensional space | Captures subtler emotional and symbolic changes |
| **LLM Integration-Ready** | Can inform newer AI models in directing emergent behavior and empathy | Bridges raw detection with adaptive generation |

### ðŸ“¢ Collaboration & Expansion  

Looking for serious collaboration for licensing, integration, and expansion.
Not seeking casual curiosity inquiries or arrangements that dilute control of the IP.
Iâ€™m a solo builderâ€”no lab, no budget, no investorsâ€”but deeply committed to exploring language, consciousness, and AI, and I treasure my personal and research autonomy.
I have many ideas and a solid foundation in place, and I look forward to monetizing as soon as thereâ€™s serious interest.
This framework is capable of directing emergent behavior in newer LLMs while enabling much richer, empathy-driven responses.

### ðŸ”œ Coming Soon  
Further demos will explore expanded terrains:  
- **LLOYD Multi**: Multi-stream variant with cross-channel bind mapping  
- **Project Doorknob** *(tentative)*: Multimodal integration with the Spanda Engine to test emotional stretch tensors across text, image, and audio layers
